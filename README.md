# roadmap
Roadmap: where we take the product in the next 1-6 months in terms of feature categories which may break down into sets of epics in the [main dotmesh project board](https://github.com/orgs/dotmesh-io/projects/1).

Note that features in this repo often correspond with hypotheses for which some level of invalidation should be attempted before code is written depending on our certainty level and the consequences of being wrong.

No code here. Go look at the [roadmap board](https://github.com/dotmesh-io/roadmap/projects/1).
